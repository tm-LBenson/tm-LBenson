Support Engineer @ Jamf · Software Engineer · Instructor

I build reliable web apps and automation for the Apple platform and the web. Day‑to‑day, I reach for TypeScript, React/Next.js, Node.js, AWS, Firebase, Docker, and Linux. I also run a small homelab and tinker with LLM/GenAI when it’s useful.

## Focus areas
- Full‑stack TypeScript (Next.js, React, Node)
- Cloud & infrastructure (AWS, Docker, Linux)
- Data & auth (SQL, MongoDB, OAuth)
- Automation & bots (Discord, serverless)
- Apple platform management (Jamf ecosystem)

## Background
Army veteran. I like clear processes, steady delivery, and helping teams ship. I also teach/mentor developers through hands‑on projects.
