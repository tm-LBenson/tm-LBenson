# Hi, I'm Lewis Benson

- I am a web developer with a passion for solving problems and a love for music. My interest in technology started at a young age, and I have always been fascinated by the way software and hardware can work together to create innovative solutions.
- I am currently attending Code Fellows, a full-time boot camp in Seattle, where I am developing my skills in web development and learning the MERN stack. I am excited to graduate in February and begin my career as a full-time developer.
- In my one year of experience in the development industry, I have worked on a variety of projects, including building a CRUD application using the MERN stack, a Spotify management application, a camp site review application, and collaborating on a game based on D&D. I have also worked on a couple of games with other Code Fellows students. I have learned to work effectively in teams and have developed strong problem-solving skills.
- Before becoming a developer, I was involved in oil and gas production, worked in the construction industry, and served in the military as a heavy equipment construction supervisor. I was first introduced to web development by my roommate while deployed to the Middle East.
- I am committed to delivering high-quality work that meets and exceeds client expectations. I enjoy the challenge of tackling complex problems and am always looking for ways to improve my skills and stay up to date with the latest developments in the tech industry.
- In my free time, I enjoy playing jazz on my guitar and saxophone, building computers, and exploring new hobbies. I have a passion for learning and am always looking for new opportunities to grow and expand my knowledge.
