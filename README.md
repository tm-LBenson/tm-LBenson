# Hi, I'm Lewis Benson

- I am a web developer with a passion for solving problems and a love for music. My skillset includes the MERN stack and I am proficient in pair programming and Jest testing.
- I am a proud veteran, having served in the military as a heavy equipment construction supervisor. My military service has given me strong leadership and problem-solving skills, and I am committed to delivering high-quality work that meets and exceeds client expectations.
- I am currently attending Code Fellows, a full-time boot camp in Seattle, where I am developing my skills in web development and learning the MERN stack. I am excited to graduate in February and begin my career as a full-time developer.
- In my one year of experience in the development industry, I have worked on a variety of projects, including building a CRUD application using the MERN stack and collaborating on a game based on D&D. I have learned to work effectively in teams and have developed strong problem-solving skills.
- I enjoy the challenge of tackling complex problems and am always looking for ways to improve my skills and stay up to date with the latest developments in the tech industry. In my free time, I enjoy playing jazz on my guitar and saxophone, building computers, and exploring new hobbies. I have a passion for learning and am always looking for new opportunities to grow and expand my knowledge.
