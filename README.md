# Hi, I'm Lewis Benson 👋

## 🌐 Web Developer | 🎶 Music Enthusiast | 🎖️ Proud Veteran

### About Me

🚀 I'm a passionate web developer with expertise in the **MERN stack**. I thrive on solving problems and creating efficient, scalable web solutions.

🎖️ My background as a heavy equipment construction supervisor in the military has instilled in me strong leadership and problem-solving skills. I strive to deliver high-quality work that meets and exceeds client expectations.

🎓 I hold a Bachelor of Science in IT with a focus on software development from Strayer University. Additionally, I graduated from [Code Fellows](https://www.codefellows.org/), a full-time boot camp in Seattle, where I honed my skills in the MERN stack. Currently, I'm an instructor at Codex Academy, where I help aspiring developers enhance their skills.

### Experience

🏗️ I've worked on a variety of projects, including CRUD applications using the MERN stack and collaborating on a D&D-based game. My focus on teamwork and problem-solving has been a key to my success. As an instructor at Codex Academy, I guide students in their journey to becoming proficient developers.

📈 I have also started Vet Stack Solutions LLC, providing freelance development services. Though still in its early stages, this venture has given me valuable experience in client interactions and project management.

🔬 I'm always eager to tackle complex problems and stay updated with the latest tech trends. In my free time, I enjoy playing jazz on my guitar and saxophone, building computers, and exploring new hobbies. My love for learning drives me to constantly seek out new knowledge and growth opportunities.
