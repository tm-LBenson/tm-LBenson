# Hi, I'm Lewis Benson 👋

## 🌐 Web Developer | 🎶 Music Enthusiast | 🎖️ Proud Veteran

### About Me

🚀 I'm a web developer with a passion for solving problems and a love for music. I'm proficient in the **MERN stack**, pair programming, and Jest testing.

🎖️ As a heavy equipment construction supervisor in the military, I developed strong leadership and problem-solving skills. I'm committed to delivering high-quality work that meets and exceeds client expectations.

🎓 Graduated from [Code Fellows](https://www.codefellows.org/), a full-time boot camp in Seattle, where I enhanced my web development skills and learned the MERN stack. Actively seeking new opportunities as a full-time developer.


### Experience

🏗️ In one year of experience, I've worked on various projects, including a CRUD application using the MERN stack and collaborating on a game based on D&D. I've learned to work effectively in teams and developed strong problem-solving skills.

🔬 I enjoy tackling complex problems and staying up to date with the latest developments in the tech industry. In my free time, I love playing jazz on my guitar and saxophone, building computers, and exploring new hobbies. I have a passion for learning and am always looking for opportunities to grow and expand my knowledge.
