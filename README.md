# Hi, I'm Lewis Benson

I am a web developer with a passion for solving problems and a love for music. With one year of experience in the development industry, I have honed my skills in the MERN stack and am committed to delivering high-quality work that meets and exceeds client expectations. Whether I'm working on a project or playing jazz on my guitar and saxophone, I am always striving to improve and stay at the top of my game. I am also an avid builder of computers and enjoy staying up to date with the latest tech developments. In my free time, I love exploring new hobbies and learning new things.
